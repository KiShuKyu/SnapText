Mouse down → record start (x1, y1)
Mouse move → draw rectangle
Mouse up → record end (x2, y2)

Implemented interactive region-based screen selection using event-driven GUI overlays to support targeted OCR workflows
OCR engines secretly convert images to numbers anyway — NumPy lets you control that process.
Improved OCR accuracy on complex UI screenshots by implementing adaptive OpenCV preprocessing including adaptive thresholding, noise reduction, and morphological cleanup.
Integrated an LLM-based post-processing step to clean, normalize, and summarize OCR-extracted text for improved usability.
Automated clipboard integration to instantly copy, OCR-extracted text for seamless,


Common things OpenCV does before OCR:
Convert to grayscale
Increase contrast
Thresholding
Remove noise (dots and shadows) -> gone
Resize text

opencv and numpy are helping pytesseract to read the blurry words better
pytesseract is the one who is ocring
